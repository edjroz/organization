## Proposal
Unstake and move funds from legacy pocket nodes to raise more money and avoid risk of chain halt

### Detailed Summary of Proposal
The 1-10 legacy nodes we use as part of our infrastructure needs to be unstaked and reduce the POKT amounts in order to raise more money. Also this will allow us to reduce the risk of chain halt in case of outages  

### Estimated Timeline
2 Week

**Evidence and Justification for this timeline:**
We need a smooth coordinated unstake process for each node, considering the time for the network to pickup the state of the nodes and verify that everything is happening smoothly 


**Timeline Consultants**
 - Consultant 1: Lowell Abbottt
 - Consultant 2: Julio Jimenez

### How to test functionality?
The legacy pokt nodes should have 16k POKT after the unstake operation its sucessfully done

### Project Abstractions
- Project 1
    - Unstake of every node caerefully
    - Verification of quantity of POKT for every node is 16k
    - Verification of the status of online service status is working

### QA Planification
After every unstaked node. We will perform a status check of the online proxy availability and
