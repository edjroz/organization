## Description of Proposal
### Background

Since our initial launch we have been using a custom version of tendermint with modification to suit our needs.

### Goal
This proposal looks forward to adding new changes to tendermint and pocket core to increase the visibility and information provided
by events that start or happen at the tendermint layer (jailing, voting, double signing, etc...),
helping us to handle them more efficiently and enabling us to take actions if necessary.

### Estimated completion time
4 weeks
