### Description of Proposal
As we know, all projects worked from now on should comply with a QA Certification process at several stages:
- Milestone level
- Project level
- Issue level

And it is with us, engineers working in this projects, the dutty of a great QA documentation and further execution to validate the quality of the project being worked at that specific phase.

It is also known that not all projects will require the same level of exhaustivity and focus in relation to the quality assurance, as it will directly depend on the details/elements/components/characteristics of that project, and the level of that QA certification. Meaning, for example, that the QA Certification execution process at a project's issue level could not be the same as the one in a milestone level. In specific cases, this could be the opposite and the QA certification process could be the same or at least very similar depending on the size of the project, and so on.

Therefore, I propose that we should work towards the creation of a QA Certification Template that can be used in any project at any level, by making it flexible and adjustable enough to be handled at all scenarios within a milestone, without sacrifying quality.

Possible QA Certification Framework breakdown/tasks/steps:
- Project's description skeleton/template.
- Project's QA Goals skeleton/template.
- Project goal's scenario skeleton/template.
- Project scenarios' testcases skeleton/template.
- Project's QA planning/execution skeleton/template.
- Project's QA Results Reporting skeleton/template/tool.
- Project's QA Certification metrics and conclusions rules.
- Project's QA Certification metrics and conclusions skeleton/template.

Output/Gains:
- Trusted and approved template, that will serve to provide engineers an excellent background on how to approach their QA Certification processes within their milestones.
- Quality Assurance framework that will serve as a quality warranty for each project of the Pocket Organization.
- Result of a quality warranty, will lead to great user's trust and satisfaction in our milestones/organization.
- Reduction of double-working, re-working, loop holes, others.
- QA mentality/culture transmissor over the Organization.
- QA Certification process execution totally decentralized.
