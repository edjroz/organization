name: Infrastructure budget optimization 
about: Since the release of 0.5.1 until the release of 0.5.2.9 and during the growth of the network. We faced the need of spin up resouces to meet the demand of the network and correct functioning of the network. Today with the great work done by blockchain-dev and further analysis of our current infrastructure. We concluded that we can reduce optimize the infrastructure budget/usage

### Description of Proposal
We just identified various opportunities after and with the release of 0.5.2.9 which result in better resource management and will improve our savings. 
Preliminary analysis of the benefits of this proposal show us that we will be saving ~$2000-4500 monthly which will allow us to resume the integration for more blockchains and lower our infrastructure costs


Tasks to be done:

- Investigate the resources and opportunities for lowering our budget and estimate the savings 
- Create proxy access to connect blockchains from production cluster to testnet validators and  Delete testnet blockchains
- Investigate and resize pocket seed nodepool 


Output:
- $2000-4500 in savings in our current infrastructure
- Allow us to resume the integrations with other blockchains
