### Description of Proposal
This proposal basically resumes the documentation efforts aimed at providing:

- Basic infrastructure quality
- Node growth
- Easy usage of pocket core
 

This project will conclude with a medium post with all the available pocket core node deployment options available

Is a complex project because it requires high level of maintenance in terms of documentation and deployment code in the blockchain we support and the support software we suggest to use (prometheus/grafana/nginx/etc)

Below are the tasks mentioned. All of the deployment artifacts mentioned has 2 configurations:

- basic (which is only the pocket software)
- stack (which contains monitoring/proxy/ssl/alarms) 

Tasks to be done:

- Refactor pocket-core-deployment organization and documentation
- Provide script for setting up pocket blockchain and pocket validator 
- Provide docker-compose with tutorial for providing pocket blockchain and validator 
- Provide basic pocket yaml with tutorial for providing pocket blockchain and validator 


Output:
- Improve learning curve of node operators and infrastructure documentation quality
- Improve node growth as result of easy to use quick setup
- Profit?
