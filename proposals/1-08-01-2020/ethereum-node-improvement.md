### Description of Proposal
We are currently facing perfomance issues with our ethereum full node. We think is better to change the client but this requires time to investigate and sync in order to switch with the current ethereum full node. 

Tasks to be done:

- Investigate which is the best ethereum client to replace our current ethereum node 
- Spin up the node and wait for sync
- Replace the node

Output:
- A little of budget savings 
- High perfomant ethereum request and up-to-date block height
